A number of colleagues tweeted about the the WIRED magazine article by Kathy Sierra titled ["Why the Trolls Will Always Win"](http://www.wired.com/2014/10/trolls-will-always-win/). I finally read it today. Its a very well-written, and gutsy article. (A  troll is abusive online personality, eg posts abusive comments, particularly taregeted at prominent women, incites conflict, narcissistically dominates discussions.) Kathy's article follows many recent news stories of women experiencing online attacks. In Kathy's experience, the natural responses do not work - leave, ignore them, fight back - trolls will win with each action. 

Being a woman, in a math and computing dominated field where the numbers are still imbalanced, takes effort, but it is getting better. It is tiring, and wearing, being minority in a group. I am tired, and constantly doubt my validity, worth, contributions. 

About the same time that the Wired article was printed, I was listening to an interview with [Michel Martin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Martin), the full transcript is available [here](http://www.onbeing.org/program/transcript/6801#main_content). Michel Martin hosted an NPR show titled "Tell Me More" but is beginning a new show "NPR Presents Michel Martin" this month. There are two messages that she gave that are very important for encouraging diversity, and fostering creativity:

- "...I felt like I had been in so many rooms where people kept talking about `we' this and `we' that, and they weren't talking about me. And again, it was not aimed at the mean, you know, racist people who don't want to hear it. It was aimed at the good people who are oblivious to other people's truths."
- "My real charge to people is to look around and see who's missing. And try to invite that person." 

I would encourage you further:

- If you have white male privilege, be aware of your power, in an anarchic environment, like the internet (like the school playground), stand up for victims of bullies. The bully will likely crumble to your challenge, and stop. Your challenge lets them know that you support the presence of the victim and value their contributions.
- If you are a young up and coming researcher, believe in the authority of female researchers who have walked the path ahead of you, don't fall into the trap of assigning authority only to the males in your environment.
- If you are working in men's sports statistics, pick a women's sport to study, also. 
- Listen to the quiet voices, and watch people's actions.
